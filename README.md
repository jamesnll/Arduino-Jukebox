# Arduino-Jukebox
This project uses the Arduino Uno Rev3 board and a number of different modules listed below to play nine songs that the user can choose from by controlling an IR remote.
Each of the songs are loaded onto a microSD card and are controlled using the DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player module, which is connected to an 8 ohm micro speaker.

## Modules Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR Receiver
- IR Remote
- DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player
- 8 ohm micro speaker
- MicroSD Card

## Songs Used
These songs are stored locally on a microSD card to be used with the DFPlayer Mini module.

001 - Better Off Alone - Alice Deejay <br>

## Archive Folder

This folder contains old files that aren't being used by the project but I felt the need to leave them for display of my initial thoughts to play music on this project.

- songs - Uses a passive buzzer to play tones at a set frequency for a set duration to mimic the chorus of a song.
